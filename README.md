# PetShelter
An application for a dog shelter that can be used in two modes: administrator and user.
Administrator mode: the administrator can see all the dogs in the shelter, add a new dog, delete a dog and update the information of a dog. Each Dog has a breed, a name, an age and a photograph. The photograph is memorised as a link towards an online resource.
User mode: the user can choose one or more dogs to adopt and see the adoption list as a CSV or HTML file.

The GUI was made with QT, so you have to install Qt to be able to run this application.
